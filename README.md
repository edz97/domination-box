 The Domination Box - Capture The Flag - Electronic Paintball Airsoft Milsim Prop 


Domination box project for counting points for 2 teams
and showing box owner status via led. The goal is to get a real life example of capture points as seen in many shooter games


This project is still in the development phase.




Story of the project

This project started as a domination box created by engineeringshock.com. 
https://www.paintballprops.com/domination-box.html link to original product.

Because engineeringshock only sold the electronics a box was build to host all of it. This is the same box i currently use. The mainboard eventually died and insted of buying a new set of electronics i started this project to revive it. I could just changed the main board with an arduino and called it a day but i wanted to do some changes aswell so here we are.



Current issues and feature thought on the project

Story first test:

A friend wanted to test it now during easter so i slapped everything from the test bench into the case due to short notice. As expected it started 
breaking down fast. I fixed it with some hot glue on the connectors and it worked again. It stayed in working conditions until day 4 when someone run over it and tripped the whole pole over. This killed the led strip i had just hanged over the pole as indicator on box owner.

Results first test:

- This confirmed what i already knew that the components needs to be mounted in a sturdier way

 The options im now considering is  either going for all component into terminal blocs and wire them together by them or going for a Prototyping board and try to solider as much as possible to it. The final solution is likely going to be a hybrid of these 2.

 - The box needs to be mounted higher and the button presses must be in a way downward to avoid tripping the pole over
