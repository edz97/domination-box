 The Domination Box - Capture The Flag - Electronic Paintball Airsoft Milsim Prop 


Domination box project for counting points for 2 teams
and showing box owner status via led. The goal is to get a real life example of capture points as seen in many shooter games


This project is still in the development phase.




Story of the project

This project started as a domination box created by engineeringshock.com. 
https://www.paintballprops.com/domination-box.html link to original product.

Because engineeringshock only sold the electronics a box was build to host all of it. This is the same box i currently use. The mainboard eventually died and instead of buying a new set of electronics i started this project to revive it. I could just changed the main board with an arduino and called it a day but i wanted to do some changes aswell so here we are.



Current issues and feature thought on the project

Story first test:

A friend wanted to test it now during easter so i slapped everything from the test bench into the case due to short notice. As expected it started 
breaking down fast. I fixed it with some hot glue on the connectors and it worked again. It stayed in working conditions until day 4 when someone run over it and tripped the whole pole over. This killed the led strip i had just hanged over the pole as indicator on box owner.

Results first test:

- This confirmed what i already knew that the components need to be mounted in a sturdier way

 The options im now considering are either going for all components into terminal blocks and wire them together by them or going for a Prototyping board and trying too solider as much as possible to it. The final solution is likely going to be a hybrid of these 2.

 - The box needs to be mounted higher and the button presses must be in a way downward to avoid tripping the pole over

This is easily fixed with some 90 brackets. Preferably in a way so it's easy to assemble/disassemble the box from the pole for easier transportation. 

- The box is not super user friendly  

I want to make the box so it's super friendly to use. The feedback i got is that i need to simplyfi the design so the user only can see 2 buttons colored according to the team they are on to avoid mistakes. Blue teams' button is currently green, and the buttons need to be bigger and easier to push. power button needs to be moved to a more discreate place
