This is not the finnished state of the drawing as the project is still in development stage and will probably be split into a seperate drawing for each mayor component with the goal of increased readability. The current state is just to showcase how its currently wired up.

The resistor for the transistors is to make a small current go trough the transistor for it to open fully. I run with 1K ohms now with the current transistors

The resistors after the switches is pull down resistors for eliminating floating input problems. Different values work and i currently run with 4.7K ohms because that was what i had at hand.   

The arduino runs on 5-12v(up to 24v on short intervalls) but the led strips is 12v so i recommend running with that. I have tested it at 11.1v and it work but the leds are a litte dimmer.
